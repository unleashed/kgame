KGame scraper - An XGProyect game scraper library

This library connects to websites hosting XGProyect games (specifically
v2.9.9 Rp1 ExTreme) and gets information on the current state of the
game.

It has been used to program robots (not included) that act upon the
different conditions that the game presents.

DEPENDENCIES
============

Ruby 1.9 (tested only on ruby 1.9.2) and the Mechanize gem (tested on 2.0.1).

STATUS
======

The library scrapes most of the important production values of the game,
and provides facilities to change the status of the player (eg: build new
infrastructure, research new technologies, etc).

Some information gathering and capabilities are missing but are easily
implementable. This includes most of the flight information, fleets, and
hangar and defense data. Someone should write those, and contributions are
welcome.

This library does not model any dependency between the game objects other
than basic ones like resource requirements, but it provides enough information
for an external program to use the data and order the library to perform
actions based on that data.

For starters, an implementation of a robot which limits itself to keep
building mines and power plants is straightforward. More complicated
robots can implement some AI concepts to perform better decisions, such as
exchanging some resources for others, transporting them between planets
as needed, or maximizing the resource production through a combination of
mine building, power plants and solar satellites, and other buildings.

If you ever write such a robot I'll be happy to accept patches for the
library (and possibly at least have a look at your robot or set apart
an examples directory).

ERROR HANDLING
==============

Basically non-existant. Patches accepted.
